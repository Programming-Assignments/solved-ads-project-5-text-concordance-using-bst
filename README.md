See the description of this problem in the book for further details.

Write a cross-reference program that constructs a binary search tree (any type, including splay tree) with all words included from a text file and records the positions (word or line numbers) on which these words were used. These line numbers should be stored on linked lists associated with the nodes of the tree. After the input file has been processed, print in alphabetical order all words of the text file along with the corresponding list of numbers of the lines in which the words occur.
